# Transparent Dash: Ethical AI Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
Transparent Dash is designed to enhance the transparency of AI systems and reduce bias through an interactive dashboard. This project combines data analysis, predictive modeling, and user-centric design principles to provide actionable insights into AI behaviors and decision-making processes. This is a passion project aimed at bridging the gap between AI technologies and user trust.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Leverage extensive datasets to identify and analyze biases in AI.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Use predictive algorithms to forecast the impact of biases.
- **User Interface**: A clean, intuitive dashboard that presents information effectively.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Note that this project is a WIP.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 12.x+
- Figma account for accessing UI prototypes

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
